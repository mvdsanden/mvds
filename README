Marten VD Sanden (mvds) Stash of Classes
########################################

This repository contains several classes and small projects
which I use or work on at the moment.

2009-10-25 -- Initialization date, nothing much added yet. Only
			  a few things I'm working on at the moment.
			  FSA - A Finite State Automaton class (unfinished),
					which I'm creating to make a regular expression
					system. Usable for creating a lexical analyser.
			  RegVM - A virtual machine that is intended for running
					  regular expression code, that is generated by
					  a future project.

More things will be added in the future.

Cheers,

Mart
